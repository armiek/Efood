######Top 5 Cities with the most breakfast orders are Volos - Rodos - Xanthi - Î™oannina - Larissa.
##### Rodos, Volos and Xanthi are the top three, breakfast orders are the most at these cities
#### however, Larissa's users spend more in ordering meat rather than breakfast and customers at Ioannina
### prefer meat as well - however the difference beetween orders of meat and breakfast is not such a large 
## as we notice in Larissa's customers.
